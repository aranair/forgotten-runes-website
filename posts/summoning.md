On July 30th, at roughly 8:30 am, a crow perched upon the Secret Tower, and the Tower came alive. Within a frenzied timespan of 20 minutes, our community had summoned all ten thousand Wizards, and the Secret Tower closed once again.

There are 10,000 unique Wizard NFTs. The Summoning began on [Ethereum block 12736300](https://etherscan.io/block/countdown/12736300), which was on June 30th, 2021.

The Wizards are encoded fully on-chain. The image of each Wizard is 50x50 pixels, scaled to 400x400. Each Wizard has a unique name and configuration of traits.

Each wizard was summoned for 0.07 ETH, with a maximum of 12 summoned per transaction.
